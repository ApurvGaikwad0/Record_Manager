# Record_Manager
The Record Manager is responsible for managing tables with fixed schemas, supporting operations such as record insertion, deletion, update, and scanning. It builds upon the previously implemented Storage Manager and Buffer Manager modules and includes an innovative tombstone mechanism to track deleted records without wasting disk space.
